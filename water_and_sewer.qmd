This section will show an example of how water and sewer network is designed. The study site is a town plan zone of Isokuusi in Vuores neighborhood of Tampere, Finland. The software used for designing the water and sewer network was Fluidit Water and Fluidit Sewer. 

For water network, we used branch and loop system to design the network to ensure the cost efficiency and the quantity of water distribution to the customers. The loop system was used to make the distribution run smoothly even when there was a pipe burst. Branched system was used when there were customers at the border of the network or the demand was not too many in number. The water network was designed based on 4 scenarios.

- Maximum unit headloss: should be 1-5 m/km in dimensioning scenario. Values between 8 and 10 are acceptable in extreme cases.

- Minimum pressure: typically over 25 m

- Pressure difference: the values should ideally be less than 5 mwc/d. Values between 8 and 10 are acceptable.

- Maximum velocity: the values should be below 0.5 m/s. Values << 0.1 m/s might lead to water quality problem as the water might get stale.

For the scope of this project, the cost for installing the main pipeline was calculated. The calculation was done by Fluidit software. The map below shows the cost for each segment of pipe.
