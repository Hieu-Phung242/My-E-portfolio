    "text": "Hello\nMy name is Hieu Phung.\nI am currently studying Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management at The University of British Columbia.\nBefore coming to Canada, I have completed my Bachelor’s in Energy and Environmental Engineering at Tampere University of Applied Sciences in Finland. I also completed one Master’s programme in Environmental Engineering in Tampere University in Finland.\nIt is interesting that, after my first master’s graduation, I decided to revolve my career path to the field of GIS and Forestry.\nIn my e-portfolio, I hope to deliver insights, creativity and innovations to readers.\nThank you and enjoy your time exploring my space. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send me an email.\n\nSkills: ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, R coding, Python, ENVI, AutoCAD, AutoCAD Plant 3D"
