I also completed one Master’s programme in Environmental Engineering in Tampere University in Finland.\nIt is interesting that, after my first master’s graduation, I decided to revolve my career path to the field of GIS and Forestry.\nIn my e-portfolio, I hope to deliver insights, creativity and innovations to readers.\nThank you and enjoy your time exploring my space. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send me an email."
