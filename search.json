I also completed one Master’s programme in Environmental Engineering in Tampere University in Finland.\nIt is interesting that, after my first master’s graduation, I decided to revolve my career path to the field of GIS and Forestry.\nIn my e-portfolio, I hope to deliver insights, creativity and innovations to readers.\nThank you and enjoy your time exploring my space. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send me an email."

For example, here is a link to a Google Earth Engine application I developed. The full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
